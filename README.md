Simply download the files into an empty folder and run setup.py

For the script to work you need to download *pscp*, to do so either google it

or visit http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html



After the setup the script will allow you to upload files via pscp to your account at the tu berlin unixpool.

You just have to input your account and the file name.

Please note that you need a working account at the unixpool to upload files.

If you want to also access the account via ssh (console) and not only upload files,

I would recommend to download Putty!

You don't need anything besides Putty to get access to your account via ssh.
