Simply download the files into an empty folder and run setup.py

For the script to work you need to download *pscp* either google it

or visit http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html


This will allow you a more easy approach to upload files to the tu berlin unixpool.

Please note you need a working account at the unixpool to do so.


If you want to also access the account through ssh (console) and not only upload files,

I would recommend you to download Putty!

You don't need anythin besides Putty to get access.

It is easy to use!
